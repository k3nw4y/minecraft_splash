Minecraft splash texts

Splash texts are yellow lines of text on the title screens, randomly chosen from the game's files and often featuring references to popular culture (e.g. websites, quotes, video games). The splash pulsates on the title screen at a frequency of 2 Hz (120 beats per minute).

Splash texts are not translated and appear the same regardless of the chosen language setting.
